## Project Overview

This project is a Flask-based web application that integrates with ArangoDB, LangChain, and GROQ to provide a powerful interface for querying and visualizing graph data. The application allows users to input natural language queries, which are then translated into ArangoDB Query Language (AQL) using LangChain. The results can be visualized using NetworkX and Matplotlib, and the visualizations are rendered in the web interface.

| Sl. No. | Feature Name                            | Description |
|---------|-----------------------------------------|-------------|
| 1       | **Natural Language to AQL Translation** | Converts natural language queries into AQL using LangChain and executes them on an ArangoDB database. |
| 2       | **Graph Visualization**                 | Generates and visualizes graph data using NetworkX and Matplotlib. The visualizations are saved as static images and displayed in the web interface. |
| 3       | **GROQ Integration**                    | Utilizes GROQ's language models for enhanced query processing and visualization code generation. |
| 4       | **Flask Web Interface**                 | Provides a simple web interface to interact with the application, submit queries, and view results. |

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- ArangoDB (running locally or accessible via a network)
- GROQ API key

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your GROQ API key:
   ```
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
   ```

5. **Configure ArangoDB**:
   Ensure ArangoDB is running and accessible. Update the connection details in the code if necessary:
   ```python
   clien = ArangoClient(hosts='http://localhost:8529')
   db = clien.db('_system', username='root', password='')
   ```

## Running the Application

1. **Start the Flask Application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Access the Web Interface**:
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## Usage

### Querying the Database

1. **Enter a Query**:
   - On the home page, enter a natural language query in the input box.
   - Click "Submit" to execute the query.

2. **View Results**:
   - The results of the query will be displayed on the same page.
   - If the query includes visualization keywords (e.g., "visualize", "show"), a graph will be generated and displayed.

### Example Queries

- **Simple Query**:
 
  List all users and their purchased products.
  

- **Visualization Query**:
  
  Visualize the network of users and their purchased products.
  

## Code Structure

- **app.py**: The main Flask application file containing routes, query handling, and visualization logic.
- **templates/index.html**: The HTML template for the web interface.
- **static/**: Directory for storing static files like generated plot images.

## Tools and Libraries

## Technology Stack

| Sl. No. | Technology  | Description |
|---------|------------|-------------|
